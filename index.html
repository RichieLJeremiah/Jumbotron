                    One of my very numberous list of hobbies is cross-country. I may have only been in it for about 3 weeks but thats besides the point. I've been running, pretty averagely, but I enjoy it nonetheless, no matter how much my legs scream for the sweet relief of a chair

                <div class="col-lg-6-2">
                    Another one of my many hobbies is playing videogames. Many people think that they're for losers, and I have to half-way agree with that. I like to say I'm a winner and I do a lot with my life, but then again I do have the diet of a rat in South Carolinas sewer system.
